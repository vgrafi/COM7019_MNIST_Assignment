# # COM7019 – Assignment (Task 1)

This repository contains the Python implementation for Task 1 of the COM7019 Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks assignment.

The notebook trains a deep neural network (NumPy) on the MNIST dataset and compares Sigmoid vs Tanh activation functions in the hidden layers. The output layer uses Softmax for 10-class digit classification.

## Repository contents
- `Assignment.ipynb`  
  Jupyter Notebook containing implementation, training, evaluation, and plots.
- `npy-files.zip`  
  Zipped dataset files:
  - `train_images.npy`
  - `train_labels.npy`
  - `test_images.npy`
  - `test_labels.npy`

## How to run
1. Clone/download this repository.
2. Extract `npy files.zip` into the same folder as `Assignment.ipynb`.
3. Open `Assignment.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab.
4. Run cells from top to bottom to reproduce results.
